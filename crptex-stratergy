Everytime user passes a level it will be added to his db with the time, level and time.
Time should be less and level higher in sorting.
We can't position of any user by using indexOf.

User Table : 50 in one time, more(50) load on scrolling down.
db.users.find({'cryptexLevel' : { $exists : true}}).pretty()^C

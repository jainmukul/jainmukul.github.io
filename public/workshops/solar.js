    eventDesc : `<p>How to look at the sun using a telescope? Ever wondered how changes in solar atmosphere can affect Earth’s
                climate? What are sunspots? How can we locate them? Why does the sun appear white, inspite of being a mixture
                of numerous colours? Heard of Instagram filters, but what are solar filters? And where are they used? Can unsafe
                gazing at the sun lead to permanent blindness? Most people take it for granted. But if you stop and look around,
                you will realize that there is more to it than what meets the eye. The sun is mightier than the mythological theories
                concerning it. Your insatiable appetite for answering these mind-boggling questions will be resolved in this
                intriguing workshop on Solar Astronomy. Solar Astronomy is the branch of astronomy that specializes in the study
                of sun. From solar flares, sunspots, prominences, solar storms, get to know everything about the sun, our closest
                star. Join in to observe the sun with special solar equipment and imaging telescopic observations.</p>`,

    eventDesc : `<p>It is workshop for those who gets excited by vehicles. In the 15 hours of workshop, the participants will be taught basics of automobile, its working principles, simulation, design and manufacturing a prototype of an automobile. It will provide an insight on how to collaborate design with various automotive components to design a better vehicle in all the terms. Students who are pursuing engineering can learn various concepts regarding engineering mechanics, engineering design of machine elements and mechanics of material using software like CAD/CAE.

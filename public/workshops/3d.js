    eventDesc : `<p>3D Printing is an Additive Manufacturing technique that creates a physical object from a virtual 3D CAD model by depositing successive layers of material. They work like the traditional inkjet printers, but instead of ink, a 3D printer deposits desired material to manufacture an object from its digital format. 3D printing and rapid prototyping, in general, are widely claimed to have revolutionized not only the manufacturing industry but also many other walks of life like medicine, aerospace and autom -otive industry. This program on 3D Printing helps the participants understand the design, functioning and operation of a basic 3D Printer.</p>`,

<h4>Problem Statement</h4>
<ol>
<li>At the beginning of the Astro Hunt each team will be given a map of the LNMIIT Campus 
and a Sky chart. 
</li>

<li>Astro Hunt will consist of 4 rounds.
</li>
<li>At the beginning of each round every team will receive an identical set of clues or 
puzzles which must be solved in order to find a piece of information. This information 

could be words from a historical astronomical event, name of a star, planet or any other 

celestial body, cosmic theories or just a name of a person. The clues and puzzles will be 

related to astronomy in some manner and will lead to a location/check point within 

walking distance where players will use a vital piece of information to answer a 

question.

<li>After completing a round by solving the puzzles/clues and reaching the check point the 
teams will get a flag and the clues/puzzles for the next round.

participants will have to solve the final puzzle.
</li>

                        Model United Nation holds every year in The LNMIIT, Jaipur, India.<br>
                        This Conference is organised by the Student body. My sole contribution to this Conference was to design and to provide an online platform through which various participant from various other institutions can access information regarding event and can pay for the event. (Registrations was through google form)</p>

                        <p class="roboto">Our Aim was to keep things simple as possible in every respect and Mobile ready to provide the best experience everywhere. To enable one-click payment for the events and saving the user from filling two forms(one at ticketing website), we have also integrated Paytm payment gateway.
